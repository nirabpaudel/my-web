This time, I had an idea. I silently set up cameras around my home to see if I could catch the old man on video. The following day, I checked the recordings, and what I saw horrified me. The old man had been staring at my room through the window the entire night. "Is he planning something against me? Why is he acting like such a creep? Is he planning to kill me?" I asked myself these questions while I took the recordings and showed them to Autumn in the same cafe where we had met yesterday. For the first time, Autumn looked sad and miserable. She almost started crying. "Alex, I never thought this would be the way you would find out about your grandfather." "Grandfather?" I cried. "Yes, grandfather," she said. A series of emotions ran within me. Now, I had even more questions than I initially had. "But..." I was about to say something when Autumn said, "I know you might have many questions right now. You must be wanting to know why your grandfather murdered so many people and why we decided to keep it a secret from you." I shook my head in approval.<br><br>
"Well, your grandfather hasn't been the best person. He always spent his nights in the casino, gambling all his money, drinking alcohol, and doing drugs. One day, he got so high that he decided to commit wrong deeds under the influence. Once he sobered up enough, he felt so bad about what he had done and lived every second of his life in regret. He didn't want you to know that you have the same blood as a criminal who committed such a fatal crime. And if you might ask, he already turned over himself to the police this morning. He just wanted to see you for the last time before spending his last breath in prison." I didn't know what to say. I felt bad for him, but at the same time, I understood what he had done was brutal, and he had to be punished for it. However, I felt happy that the unknown had finally been known, and now I could focus on my life and work.<br><br>
