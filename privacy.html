<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia,Times,Times New Roman,serif;">
<p>This Privacy Policy contains information about how we collect and use your data at nirabpaudel.com, nirab.info.np, nirabpaudel.com.np and all of their subdomains and pages. By using our website, you agree to all the policies mentioned herein and agree to our <a href="https://nirabpaudel.com/terms" style="color: #088F8F;">terms</a>.</p><br>
<p>Last Updated: August 08, 2025</p><br>
<p>Our main priority is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by us and how we use it. If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@nirabpaudel.com" style="color: #088F8F;">contact us</a>.</p><br>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3><br>
<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information. We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services.</p><br>
<p>If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.</p><br>
<p>The personally identifiable information we collect may include Names, Email Addresses, and Usage Data. We neither collect nor process any sensitive information.</p><br>
<h4>Information Automatically Collected</h4><br>
<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate our website and services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our services and for our internal analytics purposes. </p><br>
<h3>Log Files</h3><br>
<p>We follow a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and are a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any personally identifiable information. The purpose of the information is to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather demographic information. The types of usage data which is collected automatically when you use our website may include:</p><br>
<p><u><b>Log and Usage Data:</b></u> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages, and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</p><br>
<p><u><b>Device Data:</b></u> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</p><br>
<p><u><b>Location Data:</b></u> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the services.</p><br>
<h3>Cookies</h3><br>
<p>Like any other website, we use "cookies". These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.</p><br>
<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3><br>
<p>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p><br>
<p>We use the information we collect in various ways, including:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>To deliver and facilitate the delivery of services to the user.</li>
<li>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.</li>
<li>To send administrative information to you.</li>
<li>To fulfill and manage your orders.</li>
<li>To request feedback.</li>
<li>To send you marketing and promotional communications.</li>
<li>To protect our services.</li>
<li>To identify usage trends.</li>
<li>To determine the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional campaigns.</li>
<li>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3><br>
<p>We will retain your data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p><br>
<p>We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.</p><br>
<h3>What Legal Bases Do We Rely on to Process Your Information?</h3><br>
<p>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p><br>
<p><b><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></b></p><br>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Consent:</b> We may process your information if you have permitted us (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. </li>
<li><b>Performance of a Contract:</b> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our services or at your request before entering into a contract with you. </li>
<li><b>Legitimate Interests:</b> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
<ul>
<li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>
<li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>
<li>Analyze how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
<li>Support our marketing activities</li>
<li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
<li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Legal Obligations:</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
<li><b>Vital Interests:</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
</ul><br>
<p><b><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></b></p><br>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p><br>
<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or maybe a victim of financial abuse</li>
<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
</ul><br>

<p><b><u>CCPA Privacy Notice</u></b></p><br>
<p>This section applies only to California residents. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the rights listed below.</p><br>
<p>The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:</p><br>
<ol type="1">
  <li>every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose and</li>
  <li>every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose</li>
</ol><br>
<p>All other individuals are defined as "non-residents."</p><br>
<p>If this definition of "resident" applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.</p><br>
<p><b>Your rights with respect to your personal data</b></p><br>
<p><u>Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete</u></p><br>
<p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.</p><br>
<p><u>Right to be informed — Request to know</u></p><br>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
<li>the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</li>
<li>whether we sell or share personal information to third parties;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that we sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose;</li>
<li>the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose;</li>
<li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information; and</li>
<li>the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.</li>
</ul><br>
<p> Per applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.</p><br>
<p><u>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</u></p><br>
<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p><br>
<p><u>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</u></p><br>
<p>We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.</p><br>
<p><u>Verification process</u></p><br>
<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person with whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with the information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p><br>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information to verify your identity and for security or fraud prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p><br>
<p><u>Other privacy rights</u></p><br>
<ul>
<li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
<li>You may request correction of your data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</li>
<li>You can designate an authorized agent to request the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf per the CCPA.</li>
<li>You may request to opt-out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</li>
